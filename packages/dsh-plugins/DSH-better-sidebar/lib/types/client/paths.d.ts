 * This module is dependency-free (no node:path in the client bundle): the
 * host is the authority for path semantics, so this mirror deliberately
 * accepts a SUPERSET of absolute forms — anything a Windows host would emit
 * (drive letters, UNC) plus POSIX roots. A form the host would reject
 * (e.g. a backslash UNC path on a POSIX host) passes through here and then
 * fails loudly in the host's requireAbsolute instead of being silently
 * joined onto the cwd.

 * comment — so a produced UNC path is never joined onto the cwd.
