/**
 * Side Chat transcript mapping (browser half): turns a thread child's
 * history rows (`session.history` — the generic RPC, which reads the durable
 * log without activating the child) into compact display rows.
 *
 * A thread child's log starts with the ENTIRE inherited parent log as its
 * fork seed. The mapping therefore cuts everything up to the LAST
 * `session/end-seed` marker and maps context injections (the "Side
 * conversation boundary" prompt, plugin-sourced context) onto a collapsible
 * injection row, so the view shows only the thread's own conversation.
 *
 * Live streaming: `assistant/message` events only land when a step
 * completes, but `assistant/chunk` events stream token-level text and
 * reasoning deltas. The mapping accumulates both per block and supersedes
 * them with the assembled message once it lands (settled rows).
